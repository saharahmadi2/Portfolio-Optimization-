Portfolio Optimization Using Modern Portfolio Theory

This project uses Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) to build an investment portfolio made up of three stocks: Alpha, Bravo, and Charlie. The goal is to decide how to divide money between these stocks, so the portfolio earns at least a 10% return while keeping risk as low as possible.

The analysis uses historical summary data such as expected returns, risk (variance), and how the stocks move together (covariance).

Project Goals

Reach a Target Return:
Create a portfolio that earns at least a 10% expected annual return.

Reduce Risk:
Minimize overall portfolio risk while meeting the return requirement.

Use Quantitative Methods:
Show how math and data can help make better investment decisions.

Key Features

Portfolio Optimization:
Uses Modern Portfolio Theory to find the best mix of the three stocks.

Risk Management:
Accounts for diversification by considering how the stocks relate to each other.

Excel Solver Model:
Uses Microsoft Excel Solver to calculate the best investment weights.

Results

The final portfolio meets the 10% return goal with the lowest possible risk. The results show that spreading investments across different stocks helps reduce risk and creates a more efficient portfolio.
